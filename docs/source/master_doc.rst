The Court Data Standardization Project
======================================

Purpose
-------

As more individuals turn to online search engines for information, the need for mature tools to assist in finding the location of the correct court for a legal matter has grown. The Court Data Standardization Project is partnering with court administrators and their information technology specialists to create a court data standard that will support the transfer of information between courts and information providers such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft so that individuals can find information on the court they need.

Methodology
-----------

Data points common to courthouses in a number of diverse court systems were reviewed with an eye toward those that would be most useful to the public as well as easily maintainable by court administrators in the event of changes. This data was mapped to existing properties of Schema.org, a web metadata standardization project founded by Google, so that the information made available through this project will be consumable by existing search engines and tools.
