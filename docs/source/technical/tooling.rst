=======

To support court administrators, researchers, or anyone else interested in aggregating publically available information about courthouses, tools to automate the collection, validation, and storage of files created using the Court Data Standard have been developed. At a high level, JSON-LD information hosted by individual courthouses can be scraped from websites in bulk, validated for compliance with the standard, and stored in an RDF datastore. The datastore can be built using a variety of database dialects and is intended to be as agnostic to the end user's environment as possible.
