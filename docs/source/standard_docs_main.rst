The Court Data Standard Dictionary
==================================

To better communicate information about courts to users of search engines, the Court Data Standard is built using a mix of existing types and properties from Schema.org as well as vocabulary developed specifically to describe courts and courthouses. Schema.org is a Google-founded project that seeks to standardize the way information is exposed to search engines to produce more useful results to users. Google provides tools for web developers to create and test markup that is compliant with the standards set forth by Schema.org. As up to 93% of site visits originate from a search engine and Google has roughly a 75% share of the search market, the implementation of the Court Data Standard will result in immediate benefits to information seekers and the court administrators maintaining court websites.
